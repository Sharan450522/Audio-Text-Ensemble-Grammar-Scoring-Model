 My favorite place to visit is Jamaica. It's honestly one of my favorite islands. The first time I went there I fell in love not only with the cuisine and the people but the beautiful beautiful weather. It's always perfect around July and August. The sun is beaming. There's so much to do. In terms of food, there's a lot of great national foods such as a king's selfish, ox till and rice and please to include a huge full fried red snapper.
