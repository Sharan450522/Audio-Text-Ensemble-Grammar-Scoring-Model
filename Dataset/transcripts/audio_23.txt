 My favorite place to visit is a little place called Malam Cove, which is an England Malam Cove is a very beautiful place to visit because of the cliffs that were formed from the old limestone. It can be a little bit tricky to get there. So on your way there's like a small narrow lane and you can park close to it. You have to park a little bit further away by five minutes or so which makes it a little bit tricky.
