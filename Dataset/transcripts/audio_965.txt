 A school playground is where kids have fun. They play on swings, go down slides and run around. Some play basketball or tag while others sit and talk with friends. Teacher want to make sure that everyone is safe and having a good time. It's a happy place filled with laughter and games. I always had such a good memories in a school playground. And there's always, there is always filled with the sounds of joy and excitement,
