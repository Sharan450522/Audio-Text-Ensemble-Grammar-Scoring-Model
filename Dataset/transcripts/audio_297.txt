 I would say that the best day of my life would be the day that I was proposed to you by my husband. I think what makes this day so special is that I was surrounded by loved ones, so that was really meaningful. It was also a surprise planned by my friends, so they definitely put a lot of effort into that. And again, that meant a lot to me that they were willing to go through all of that for me.
