 My favorite hobby is doing yoga. I enjoy the fact that it's very peaceful and it allows you to meditate for a while, also that your body feels really good afterwards, like you just had a massage. You need a mat to practice this hobby and I enjoy practicing it with other people and outdoor classes or indoor classes. I usually do it in the evenings because it's easier for me and I'm free at that time.
