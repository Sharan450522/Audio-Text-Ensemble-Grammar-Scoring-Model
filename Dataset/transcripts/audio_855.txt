 At PST of life is different for everyone and can be anything small to be. In my case it was a day when I scored highest in my class. At PST of my life was full of joy and fun. Everyone was pricing me. My friends and family were proud of me for doing something that no one believed I could achieve. The day my test is as well out my life when I filled with joy. I was doing poorly in my steady scorey average months however my father thought me to never gave up.
