 My favourite place to visit is Palm Springs, California. I first travelled there in 2018 and it was after a work conference in Las Vegas that was really heaped it and it felt really magical because I got on a really small plane and the flight was really short and the airport, as soon as we landed the airport was stunning, beautiful architecture, or open air.
