 I would say my goal in life is really just to provide for my family. The biggest challenge I had for that was last year when I lost my job. And it was really difficult to provide. I think they found one few months later and it's been one of the best trials I've ever had. It's really easy to say, motivate and focus when it's my family and I care about them deeply. I just want to make sure that they have everything that they can ever need through
