 The best day in my life was when I married my husband. My life would be completely different if I didn't marry him or have met him. The special day really just made it the best day in my life because everyone that we love was there to watch us take our vows and celebrate and I would love to just relive that day over and over again. I just think of pure happiness when I think back to it.
