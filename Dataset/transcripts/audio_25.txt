 My favorite place to visit is Heart of the Beast, Fort. It's in South Africa, in the Valle or Northwest. So what I like about the place that is just magical. We call it our little Paris, hence of Africa. It's very beautiful, but I would advise you to always visit when it's summer because it's usually cold. The place is pretty full, the place is magical.
