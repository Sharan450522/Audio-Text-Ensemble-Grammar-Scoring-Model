 My favorite place to visit is the Upper Peninsula in Michigan. It can take about 6 to 8 hours to get fully up into the Upper Peninsula. There are multiple cities you can explore. There's multiple things to do. A lot of the local food and breweries is really a good place to go. You can have foods such as pasties or you can have something that's just plain.
