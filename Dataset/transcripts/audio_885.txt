 The best day of my life is when I graduated from high school. My life would be very different if I didn't graduate from high school. Without my high school degree, I would never have gotten my first job. I would never have gotten up enough money to save for my first car. My high school degree is very important without it. Many of the things in my adult life that I have accomplished when I have been possible.
