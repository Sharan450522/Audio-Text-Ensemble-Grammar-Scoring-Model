 as a 21 year old woman, my best day of my life might start by like with waking up to a beautiful sunrise feeling refreshed and energized for the day ahead. I might spend the morning indulging in my favorite activities, whether it's going for a leisure like, they surely hike in nature, practicing yoga in part or simply enjoying a lazy morning with a good book and a cup of coffee.
