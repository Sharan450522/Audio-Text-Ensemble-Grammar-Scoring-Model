 My favorite hobby is catching. I find immense joy and expressing my creativity through drawing. What I enjoy most is that sketching is a freedom it keeps about sketching is that it gives me to bring my imagination to life on labor whether it's capturing the beauty of nature or creating characters from my favorite stories. It's catching a large meter of clothes, my artistic side and create something unique.
