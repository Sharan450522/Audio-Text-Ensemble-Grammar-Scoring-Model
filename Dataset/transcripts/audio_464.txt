 So my favorite place to visit is London. I usually take a direct flight from Tokyo, which is around 14 hours. It's longer because of the war in a new crane. Some local foods are dishes that I love from London. I do love their Indian food because they do have a large Indian population as well as their craft beer because they do have a lot of breweries.
