 This is a playground. It's 11-30 and it's Monday. There are a lot of people. 4 children are playing with a ball. A tall boy is setting a sandwich and 2 short tall children are talking to him. A girl with glasses is throwing a boy into the bin. 3 other boys are playing with a ball too. And some of them are eating sandwiches. We can see a girl sitting on the bench and writing on her notebook.
