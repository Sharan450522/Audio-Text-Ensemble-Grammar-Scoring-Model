 There are lots of stalls selling fruits, veggies, clothes and more. People chat, haggle and walk around, creating an lovely atmosphere. Then just call out prizes and you can hear the sound of people bargaining. As it goes on, more shoppers arrive making the market busier towards evening. It starts quite now.
