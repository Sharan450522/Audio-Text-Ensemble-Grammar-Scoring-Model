 So today my topic is about a favorite hobby. My favorite hobby is collecting coins and drawing on mandala. So in this we use tools like pencils, stencils and everything to draw and mandala. Again for collecting coins from since from my childhood I used to collect coins and notes from different countries. It is and my favorite hobby.
