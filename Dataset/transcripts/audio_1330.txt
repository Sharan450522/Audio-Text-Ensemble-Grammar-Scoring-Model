 I think that goal that I am actually very nice to be happy completely happy because I think in this generation it's not easy to achieve. I also just mean I like to achieve like my small means of life such as having my own space because it's not easy to live with my parents right now so I think that is my really goal as of the moment. What challenges would you face?
