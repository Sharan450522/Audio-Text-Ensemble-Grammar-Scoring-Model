 I love the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. The freezing of the sand between my toys and the small. I love the fact that there is always something to do at the beach. I can assume sun bath buildings, sand castels or just relax and listen to the waves. One of our favorite things to do at the beach is the sand castels.
