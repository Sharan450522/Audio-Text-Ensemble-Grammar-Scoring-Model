 The best day of my life was when I went on a school out team with my friends. We ate delicious food and enjoy the day to the fullest. I woke up at 6 AM and got ready for the school. My mother dropped me to school. From there we went to a science park by bus. During the entire journey we danced, sung, played games and did many more fun activities.
