 My favorite hobby is diving deep into song lyrics and unrevealing their meaning. Whenever I listen to music, I'm not just enjoying the melody. I'm immersing myself in stories and emotions conveyed through the words. Whether it's a catchy through the words. Whether it's a catchy pop tune or a soulful ballad. I find myself captivated by clever words.
