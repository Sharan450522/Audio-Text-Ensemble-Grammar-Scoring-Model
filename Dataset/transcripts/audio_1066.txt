 My favorite place to visit is the sushi restaurant I enjoy, going there with a recirually cold and it's quite windy and the feeling of relief when I arrive at the sushi restaurant is just great that somehow I am now safe from the windy weather and chili cold I like looking at the menu and choosing the sushi that I enjoy It is very refreshing. I like it a lot
