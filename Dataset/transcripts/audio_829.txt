 My favorite hobby is always listening to music. Whenever I'm sad, depressed or even happy and inclusive, my hands down job would be used to take a head forward, take a forward, take my mobile and listen to music. Because it helps you relax and if I am sad, it definitely helps me to make my mind free from the thing that we deserve.
